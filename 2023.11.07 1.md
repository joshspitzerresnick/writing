Heart aching, good time to talk to friends right now and scheme?

Have spent the morning following the massacre in Gaza that‚Äôs starting right now / prison break of sorts. I kind of want to be in community and say kaddish or just sit and process / not be surrounded by an echo of every western country and military doing what it always does and the Jewish community getting really fucking right wing and militaristic right now most places I look?

Mind has been working way over capacity this morning putting things together, feel free to reach out if anyone wants to say hi / be in community / feel feelings / scheme or know schemes to plug into ‚ù§Ô∏è

There‚Äôs a kaddish happening this afternoon in the Twin Cities in Powderhorn in case anyone isn‚Äôt in the World to Come listserv yet, would love to hear what other folks elsewhere are doing / feeling / wanting to scheme? ‚ù§Ô∏èüíû

Sending all the love and care,

Josh Spitzer-Resnick

PS: anyone going to be in Atlanta Nov 10-13 with us / want to join those of us with wealth to help make it as accessible as possible for as many people that want to be there and stop US and international police and military exchanges? Lmk if anyone wants to get connected to those of us going there from the Twin Cities or Jewish folks going there / that have been doing shabbats in the forest / etc ‚ù§Ô∏è https://blockcopcity.org/call-to-action

PPS: talked with Nadav David and Aidan Orly about this a while ago and then got repeatedly burnt out by grad school, but now have a real job that gives me my evenings and weekends back. Thinking of turning a few thousand $ donations a year into a few tens of thousands $ of donations a year to where my Palestinian friends and organizers leading in this moment need it most (PYM, NSJP, etc) ‚ù§Ô∏è Perhaps I‚Äôm a bit na√Øve, but I‚Äôve talked with a handful of friends from SJP and elsewhere about what different ideas could look like, with or without the idea of reparations attached to it (though M4BL‚Äôs thought leadership on those kinds of things feels really exciting to me) but with some component of meaningful investment in a way that feels consensual and wanted and guided by those most affected. Also figuring out how to unlock matching money from my company that maybe has to go to a university or targeted scholarship? Would love to connect with folks that resonate with any of these things üíû
