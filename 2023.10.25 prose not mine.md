There is a fear instilled in our communities, by those in power, that if we honor and grieve our men, we are uplifting “terrorists” and by association, open ourselves up to surveillance and backlash

This is a weapon used by the State, and we must collectively resist these threats and repression.

Do our men not deserve to be mourned? Are their lives not divine?
