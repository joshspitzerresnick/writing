Hi , this is Josh Spitzer-Resnick - sorry it’s been so long, I don’t think we’ve talked much since 2017 🥺 how are you feeling? how is ___ ?

hearing about all the things since shabbos / simchat torah and all the reserves being called up and sent south, scared for folks 🥺

Sending all my love and care and support, also open ears if / when it would feel good to talk / vent / feel feelings / anything ❤️🥺 Feeling a lot of heart ache for what’s happening and what’s to come right now 🥺💞
