poem 11 10/25/23 (really night of 10/24/23)

pharaoh’s blade / a soldier / pain

What does it feel like to hold pharaoh’s blade?
To be in his military
To run to the Red Sea

Did I ask to be here?
Do I know these slaves?
Why are they running?
Don’t they know we have better things to do?

My wife and child is at home
The first one died in the night
I am in pain
I hope I come home

Why am I here?
Will my child come back?
Will I feel less pain?
I am being told to, pharaoh’s orders

What will happen when I catch them?
Will I kill them?
Will I bring them back?
Will they come back?
