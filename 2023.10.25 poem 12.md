poem 12 10/25/23
the entire medical system in Gaza just shut down
there is no more fuel for excavators to remove thousands of people from the rubble of collapsed buildings

~

Place these words upon your lips, between your eyes, on your hands, on your doorposts, in your heart

do not stand idly by as your neighbor’s blood is shed

do not oppress the stranger, the widow, the orphan

if you save a single life, it is as if you have saved the entire world

in every generation, you should feel as if you have personally escaped from slavery into freedom

freedom at the cost of another is not freedom
safety at the cost of another is not safety

the sea does not open that way (Aurora)

~ (song)

when you wake up and when you lie down - think of others (song)

~

may the life we lead speak for us

may the actions we take speak for us

may our children, grandchildren, great grandchildren, those that come after us, ask us where we were and what we did

may we be able to answer them

~

تذكرها عندما تقف أمام مرآتك
