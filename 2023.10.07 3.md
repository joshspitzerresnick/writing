Spent yesterday morning following the massacre happening in Gaza right now / prison break of sorts. I kind of want to be in community and say kaddish (mourning prayer) or just sit and process / not be surrounded by an echo of every western country and military doing what it always does and the Jewish community getting really fucking right wing and militaristic right now most places I look? Mind has been working way over capacity putting things together, checking in on people, feeling feelings, holding space for folks and helping folks through disillusionment into action

Some anti zionist community had a space to process and said kaddish yesterday afternoon, checking in with folks, having conversations and scheming ways to meaningful support people that need it now ‚ù§Ô∏è Feeling a lot of heart ache for what‚Äôs to come and also a lot of sadness and disappointment and disgust with a lot of mainstream Jewish community right now üò¢
