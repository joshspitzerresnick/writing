I think it’s also reasonable to mention that I’m grieving with you too, ofc in different ways 🥺 a large part of why I’m here is because of my personal connection. at the same time some of my family is safe in the north or relocated to the north, some are probably doing deeply unethical things right now either voluntarily in their career (also a way for non Ashkenazi Jewish communities to assimilate into society and escape discrimination, like the US military that sends folks to college or provide a path to citizenship) or by virtue of being born there and drafted or called from the reserves which I hate, some of my cousin’s wife’s family are captive rn for hopefully an eventual prisoner exchange which I want to happen and also ofc I want folks to be safe 😢 lot of deep tearing heart ache rn

I want my family’s safety not to be predicated on the death of my friends’ families 🥺 I don’t want my freedom at the expense of another’s freedom, that’s not freedom in the first place 🥺 I want my family and community to be on the right side of history 🥺

we can talk about it another time / the whole disillusionment story if it would feel good, but Tuesday 10/10 when I spent the day really crying for the first time in a while and writing poetry (I never do that) and not being able to do my job was the first time I had talked with my family for over 6 years since I left

I first met my cousin Guy when he visited after he was released from the army after the second intifada, all I knew about the place was I was scared to go there for my cousins’ weddings because Guy had said he almost died hiding from a car bomb and my 8 yr old self thought I would too if I went. a few days ago he told me he doesn’t think people can remember anything that has been like this (whatever that means) since 1948

I would never be able to know and it’s not the same, but I imagine there may be some similarities to being a Dutch person whose cousins are Afrikaner in apartheid South Africa, only that the Netherlands wouldn’t exist anymore. I hate (settler) colonialism and also they’re my cousins and I want to be responsible for them

I don’t know all the things that happened, but I also wouldn’t be surprised if there are a lot of similarities between what’s happening now and the partisans / resistance networks / Warsaw ghetto uprising (literally intifada). when you don’t have anywhere else to go or anything more to lose, you do whatever you can do to get out and fight back. nobody would voluntarily go like sheep to the slaughter or roll over and die or have weapons or gasses tested on them

the shtetls / small villages where Ashkenazi Jewish people were allowed to live / forbidden from owning land / dependent on being the tax collectors of the Russian Empire, Austro-Hungarian Empire, whoever the local monarchy was that wanted to shield itself from violence when they raised taxes on poor peasants in the Pale of Settlement / White Russia / Eastern Europe, have no evidence of Jewish life left besides some mass graves in the forests nearby, might be similar to the ruins of depopulated villages from 1948 now unmarked and covered by JNF (Jewish National Fund) / KK”L (Karen Kayemet L’Yisrael) forests. to this day in many Eastern European cities you see Yiddish and Hebrew in the pavement, Jewish tombstones that have been removed from graves so you step on them as you travel

on a very large communal scale (which takes a lot of disillusionment to get out of and probably most Jewish folks in my place have had to go through a long process of becoming politically aware and renegotiating their relationship to cultural and religious community if not completely leaving it, much less learning how colonialism and nationalism works), right now there is an open wound that is being touched, and the easy knee jerk trauma coping mechanism response is to put my shields up, back myself into a corner I can’t get out of, and start hurting anyone and everyone that comes close. it stings and I may have successfully (at what cost?) ensured that nobody will ever touch my open wound, but that also means the wound can never be cleaned, disinfected, bandaged, and ever begin to heal. the coping mechanism may have helped folks survive, but it doesn’t help us grow or heal or move on 😢

I’m 3rd generation here (generational experiences with immigration are certainly very different, and especially when you add proximity to / recent memory of genocide in the mix) and grew up thinking never again meant never will we let genocide happen to anyone, but really the unprocessed trauma response for many people and communities is to never let harm happen to us again. it is self blaming - never will we let ourselves be weak enough to let it happen to us again, we must always live by the sword bc we can never rely on anyone but ourselves to protect us (as opposed to collective liberation and safety in community and solidarity).

in many postcolonial contexts as well, the knee jerk trauma response also replicates harm rather than learning from it - being on one side of a violent or colonial regime actually teaches communities a lot about how to violently control, collectively punish, create hierarchies of privilege to divide and weaken communities, suppress dissent, and reproduce the way oppressive structures have treated them. the same thing happens many places colonizers have left and others have taken their place, anti colonial texts such as hind swaraj (home rule, how do you create a state after colonialism that doesn’t just replace the colonizers administering oppressive systems with colonized people administering oppressive systems? how do you create a state that actually is from and for the colonized people, includes and takes care of everyone, and does not reproduce hierarchies of state violence?). learning about punitive justice by being incarcerated doesn’t actually teach you much about transformative justice, the inclination is to use the same oppressive system of incarceration to exact justice on those that did it to you

it takes a lot of vulnerability, individual relationships and conversations, welcoming spaces, and reinforcement to show people that it is possible and ok and safe to unlearn coping mechanisms passed down in their body for generations, and that unlearning them does not mean they no longer care for their family or community or can’t be part of their culture or religion or community or safety net. I happen to be really lucky to come from a relatively progressive background and after some time was able to find others like me after I almost completely disassociated with Jewish community and judaism after becoming disillusioned with Palestine / Israel (or couldn’t wear kippot, talit, or khaki pants with a white or light blue shirt for years bc I have this image in my mind of a stereotypical male religious zionist settler in the West Bank that I wanted to distance myself from as much as possible), many others do not have the same ability to have Jewish community outside of what they grew up with

often I find that the folks that care most about me and my and my family’s wellbeing are folks that I deeply know and trust and organize with, by and large my Palestinian friends from SJP and NSJP than most other spaces and backgrounds. when we fight for each other and care for each other, we make it possible for all of us to get free together because the same large systems that hurt your communities also (in different ways) hurt my communities and other communities in solidarity with you that have your back

when I mentioned some readings / poems / tunes that are often heard in the lefty Jewish community around this, some of the ones I think of:

“Thus spoke the prophet Roque Dalton:
All together they have more death than we,
but all together, we have more life than they. 
There is more bloody death in their hands
than we could ever wield, unless
we lay down our souls to become them,
and then we will lose everything.”

http://www.auroralevinsmorales.com/red-sea.html

“This time we're tied at the ankles. 
We cannot cross until we carry each other,
all of us refugees, all of us prophets.
No more taking turns on history's wheel,
trying to collect old debts no-one can pay.
The sea will not open that way.  

This time that country
is what we promise each other,
our rage pressed cheek to cheek 
until tears flood the space between,
until there are no enemies left,
because this time no one will be left to drown
and all of us must be chosen.  
This time it's all of us or none.”

sorry for the trauma dump, no need to read or respond to stuff, wrote way too much late into the morning last night 🙃 may have some decent or meaningful context or material going into the vigil which I am so beyond confident you all will do amazing with ❤️ feel free to share with anyone that would like to know more / find it powerful, also no need to, the jist of it is I think you saw my sign yesterday. tl;dr: collective liberation is good, you’re not alone, basically background of why I’m here with you all 💞

also thinking of a quote from Ghassan Kanafani someone got me on a shirt with 6 doves carrying 6 spoons from a few years ago when some Palestinian political prisoners escaped, digging themselves out of Israeli prisons with spoons
