re: person driving into the crowd, knife, gunshot on Sunday 10/22/23

hey, I really appreciate you checking in on me ❤️

I’m a bit shaken, it didn’t seem real like it could be happening in the moment and I almost wanted to go towards it, but even more determined now

if I was that shaken when something like that happened and I am now completely safe and at home in a comfy place and working a job and eating and drinking and sleeping in a comfy and quiet bed and can voluntarily decide when I want to go out and organize and be present and care for people, that is less than a taste of what my friends and their families are going through

I feel something of a moral obligation to use my privilege to not walk away even when I can so easily and am actually incentivized to continue my life as if a genocide is not happening or apartheid and military occupation doesn’t exist, my friends and their families can’t

I remember having a similar feeling near Bethlehem staying a night with a family in Beit Sahour, asking to take a shower in the morning because I have curly hair, and realizing, as I stood naked in the shower trying to turn the tap on for only drops to come out, what it means to not have water. to not have control over the water beneath your feet or the air waves above

later in the South Hebron Hills, what it means for the military to decide an area is a closed military zone when they want you and your ancestral homes to stop existing. to watch as settlers in kippot, talit, beige khaki pants, white and light blue shirts took the same hills the military had closed, threw poison in the wells we had cleaned out, ruined the plants and trees we had planted in the village’s land. barricade themselves in with barbed wire, irrigated lawns that stopped exactly at the fence, quick calls to the military who patrols the area and can only touch Palestinians and will never touch Jewish Israelis, while the police that can touch them is never to be found. because there are two systems of law for internationals and Jewish people and Jewish citizens of Israel, and another for Palestinian and Syrian people

to feel deep anger and empathy after only two half days and a night in a closed military zone, to feel deep pain in my heart, to feel deeply uncomfortable in my body, to feel that if this is Judaism then I want none of it. to only begin to have a taste of understanding that had I spent a third day, had I spent a week, a month, a year, a decade, a life there, I would feel no care for those that constantly oppress, harass, displace, arbitrarily detain for 6 months at a time until they break my back or threaten family or make an example out of me or blackmail and make people into informants, destroy the ability to trust your neighbor, blindfold and handcuff with thick zip ties and throw in the back of a dark van and drive around for hours until you have clue clue where you are or the time of day to disorient you, barge through all the houses in the neighborhood to make their presence known, claim a family’s roof and part of their house as a military base, weld shops closed, sterilize streets in the city center of Hebron from Palestinians permanently, in the Muslim quarter of the old city of Jerusalem on Jerusalem day when settlers wave flags and sing and dance and yell and spray paint on the walls and shops magen davids and עם ישראל חי / the people of Israel live and מוות לערבים / death to Arabs like an ignorant child or gang that draws a swastika on their desk with pencil in middle school detention or spray paints one on a rock or back of a traffic sign in the middle of nowhere, that shoot, kill, my friends, family, parents, siblings, cousins, children, community. had I not known a single other person of the faith or ethnic background that my oppressors, soldiers, settlers come from, I would easily and naturally assume all of them are horrible people that want me and my family dead. I can’t imagine having any different feeling towards Nazis than I would towards non Jewish, non Roma, non queer, abled Germans who were not righteous gentiles - either they are responsible for my family’s death and the mass graves in the forest behind the shtetl of David-Horodok in what is today Belarus (Russian Empire, then Poland) where my family is with the rest of the village that did not escape before 1941 for the men and 1942 for the women and children, or they are responsible for letting my family die.

I would not ask why someone would fight back had they lived 2 days experiencing what I saw and felt, why they would refuse to be led like sheep to the slaughter or just roll over and die. I might have been too scared for my own safety to do the same, but I would fully understand why they or anyone would, after generations of deep, systematic mass displacement, genocide, apartheid, active military occupation, control over and expropriation of resources, prevention of my ability to live or learn in a school or support my family. unless I leave for another place where I can make money, at the same time physically abandoning my family and children and land and community and ability to be a parent to my children

to meet a 16 yr old in Bil’in, two years younger than me, for him to show me where on his body he had been shot 6 times, only 5 of which he went to the hospital for because one had grazed his skin and not gone too deep, some that are still in his body

to see his uncle’s grave on the path between the village and wall hiding the ever expanding Modiin Ilit who used to lead the weekly village protest to the wall after Friday jumma prayer. to know his father that carries on every Friday after salat a jumma, years and decades later in his memory

to see silvery tear gas canisters, black smoke bombs, orange rubber bullets on the ground everywhere along the path and wall, collecting for years. in a hostel later I saw a project where people had planted flowers in the shells of the smoke bombs that are all over. years later in the summer of 2020 in Minneapolis I would see the exact same model tear gas canisters and rubber bullets I had seen before

how are you feeling? 🥺💞
