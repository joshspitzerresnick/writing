Now I have seen
I am responsible
Do I want to be responsible?
Do I want to have seen?
Can I un see?

My friends, my family
Have they seen?
Can I show them?
Can they see if not with their own eyes?
What if they don’t want to see?

What if they don’t want to see?
Can I bring them with me?
What if they look back?
I miss her, can I bring her with me?

Who am I responsible to?
My friends?
My family?
Myself?

My neighbors?
The widow and the orphan?
The downtrodden, the oppressed?
The colonized?
Those who have not yet crossed the sea?

Do we have enough room for all of us?


What if the gates are closing?
The wall of water is breaking
Do I run back to get them?

What if I was also pushed from the ledge of the unbuilt pyramid?
Do I also bring my master?
What if I am both and?
Do I lessen the drops of wine for those who have not seen?

If my freedom less complete if only for myself?
Am I free?
What if I am free and unfree?
What if I am freer
Do we get free this way?
