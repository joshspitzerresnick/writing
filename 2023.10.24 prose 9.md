it is exactly those who lost family near Gaza that are telling people not to use their names and grief as an excuse for their greedy revenge

It’s the UN, why did it make the relief agency (UNRWA)?
Not because of the refugees that are cut off like us?
But again, in order to provide relief to refugees, there must be refugees
Because of this, it voted for Israel in order to make us refugees, and after that it will pay attention to us

imagine the patience and pain it takes to go on an interview like this and spill your guts about 30 members of your family having been murdered including 17 children and be asked why you’re the oppressor and what you expected to happen https://www.instagram.com/reel/CyrKB9sLTiG/

2 weeks ago there were over 5k Palestinian political prisoners in jails, Israel revoked all 18.5k work permits for Palestinian workers from Gaza trapping them, placing them in detention centers without legal aid, preventing them from returning to their families. more than 1k others have also be imprisoned from army raids of the West Bank and Jerusalem. Haaretz says Israel is not serious about returning captives nor our cousin Guy’s wife Dana’s family, and got nothing humanitarily for the 4 Israeli captives that were released. Joe Biden told Bibi to wait on the ground invasion for military advisors (that’s the word they used in the Vietnam holocaust museums) and marine generals to arrive to prepare for a broader regional war

this is genocidal

is it ok to wipe out not just families but neighborhoods because we don’t like the way someone breaks free? do they still need to be human enough, model innocent victims enough?

what does it feel like to murder over 700 people in less than 24 hours? https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2023/10/23/israel-hamas-war-live-hundreds-killed-israeli-strikes-gaza

it’s hard for me to work or focus or not have my attention split when genocide is happening. I can’t even imagine what it’s like for my friends trying to work while they don’t know if their family exists anymore or where they are

the answer not being ignore genocide so you can work, the answer being end genocide now

I swear if not every Jewish community and synagogue that is worth existing is not repeating Martin Niemöller right now and living their values that I was raised with then I don’t care if they continue to exist, and I don’t think any of the rest of my generation will care for them either

I could not care less for the German Christians that were not righteous gentiles

~ dad italics

Have you talked to your therapist about how to cope with this tragedy?

~

I am finding a lot of support in community and in living my values and from my Palestinian friends who keep checking in on me as I check in on them

~~~ later in the morning

“Israelis must ask themselves, when has killing more Palestinians resulted in better safety for Israeli society? It never has, it never will”

https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2023/10/24/israels-war-of-self-deceit

~dad italics
There are Israelis asking those questions and challenging the status quo. The question is can they take the reins of power?
~

It is beyond clear to Palestinians, the international community, and leftist Israelis that is not possible

~dad italics
So, what's your solution? Israel is not going to disappear.

I just had a legal training last night on 1st amendment and especially title VI violations when universities either discriminate between groups of people such as anti Palestinian racism, or knowingly permit hostile environments to persist after being notified

“Palestinians deplore ‘inexcusable’ UN Security Council inaction”

South Africa didn’t disappear as a land but international pressure and local resistance removed the legal codification of apartheid (despite ongoing discrimination and distribution of land and resources and generational wealth). The United States as as a territory didn’t stop existing but we fought to end slavery. I don’t believe the existence of people or land is predicated on the existence of oppression

~~~

what did it feel like, where were people, what did people do in the 80s as people put international public economic, social, cultural, legal pressure on from outside and resistance fought from inside before South African apartheid fell?

what did it feel like, where were people, what did people do in the 90s as it fell? what happened after it fell?

where were you two? what did you two do? our families? our communities in Madison, Detroit, St. Louis? the religious communities you grew up in, Bnai Amoona, Shaare Tzedek? the religious community you were part of in Ann Arbor, Boston, Madison? Mark? the governor? the president? Biden?

You're right about both SA & the USA, and of course you know that racism and violence  continues in both places.

We protested at the Capitol in Madison and in London.

I'm not sure if you're aware of this but prior to the SA divestment protests in Madison, the Capitol had been open 24/7. People sat in the Capitol so they started closing it at night at that time.

People were very happy when apartheid fell and at the same time, if you know the history of what happened there in the immediate aftermath of it falling is that violence and AIDS decimated the country. Things eventually settled down, but it was a very difficult time there for awhile.

I'm not going to speak for all the other people you're asking about.

I just texted Mark encouraging him to sign on to H. Res. 786.
