also a ceasefire is not the end of genocide, ethnic cleansing, displacement, apartheid, nor does it begin to touch reparations nor decolonization nor freedom nor liberation nor a simple apology and acknowledgment of wrongdoing :/

I feel like there is almost no win besides the boot coming down on the neck is taking a short breather before it continues, and I'm worried people will see this as something to celebrate rather than to be even more committed to ending apartheid ðŸ¥º we've seen brief breaks like this happen before, anything they can find to deflate resistance and calm public opinion until other news takes over ðŸ˜¢

I'm scared of that ðŸ¥ºðŸ˜¢

you can leave a testimonial about why participating is important to you if you want, I left this

In Judaism we fast during holy and traumatic times. On Yom Kippur, for the destruction of the first and second temples, and for Esther and Gedaliah. This is a holy time, when we are clearly given the choice to be on the right side of history, or to watch as the colonizing militaries of the world fund and perpetuate apartheid and genocide. This is a time when we have the choice to refuse for our grief to be used to oppress another people. This is a time when we have a choice to say that there is no liberation or freedom for my people without liberation and freedom for all people.

This day is a commemoration of genocide and the stealing of land and resources from native peoples, rewritten in history by a settler colonial government. To fast on a day that a settler colonial government has told us to feast and forget the genocide perpetrated by the same government is to say no, to recommit ourselves to liberation for all colonized people in all places.

Are you planning on fasting on Thanksgiving?

Iâ€™m planning on participating in the global solidarity fast on indigenous genocide day

a friend asked me this:

how do you keep your hope alive? &/or what gives you hope in times like this?

~

itâ€™s hard ðŸ¥º mostly I find that community is the most important. being present with my Palestinian friends, sitting with them, standing with them, moving with them. being with Jewish and other community that reminds me which direction is the right side of history. when Iâ€™m alone and see people moving about their daily life at work or get genocidal notifications in my family group chat, it feels confusing and hard to remember which way is the right direction, I second guess myself if Iâ€™m being unreasonable or doing too much or too upset. I need that community to remind me where I need to be, I feel like a lot of my actions in the past months have felt like a magnetic compass rose vaguely pulling me where I need to be without telling me why, then when Iâ€™m there I realize I needed to be there ðŸ¥º

I know my Palestinian friends are not ok, I know I have the choice to walk away from this like itâ€™s not my problem or moral obligation, I know they donâ€™t. I know they can not and will not while their families can not and will not. I know they can not and will not while they are not free. I know I want to be right by their side. I know I want them to know that Iâ€™m with them until the end, however and wherever and whenever feels helpful and wanted and consensual ðŸ¥º I know I want them to know that my grief is connected with theirs, that the same system that kills their families is hurting my family and community too in different ways ðŸ¥º I want them to know that there is no freedom or liberation for my community without freedom or liberation for theirs

and in spite of all of this, under the heaviest boot comes the most resilient, powerful, beautiful resistance. a growing global understanding of collective liberation. people who are so deeply in it together that we take care of each other. the most incredible young organizers shutting down universities and institutions. I donâ€™t know what it felt like to vehemently oppose South African apartheid or the Vietnam war or any of Americaâ€™s conquests, but I can only imagine what it feels like for the world to wake up

and even if the world or our generation had not begun to wake up to the reality of apartheid and colonization, I know with my heart that I still need to face the right side of history. I know that whenever the history books are rewritten and colonized peopleâ€™s narratives are told, I will be able to answer my children and grandchildren and great grandchildren or whenever comes after me
