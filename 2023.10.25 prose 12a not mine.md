It is condescending beyond words to lecture people who have been trapped in an open air prison - in a concentration camp - what is the proper way to free themselves

The onus to be nonviolent is not on the people who have been imprisoned, bombed, shot at, raped for nearly a century. Why should they be expected to continue peacefully enduring all this, to continue peacefully watching their neighbors, friends, family be taken from them.

Calling for Palestinians to be peaceful while they experience a new massacre with every breath they take - that is the true violence.
