Thanks a lot my dear 
In Jerusalem it’s fine
My mind is with all the civilians who has nothing not even a shelter in Gaza and has no idea when are they going to die 😖😖

Hopefully this finishes asaaaap

Hopefully you are fine and everything is fine on your side 🥰

It’s so good to hear from you 🥰❤️

Some anti zionist community had a space to process and said kaddish (mourning prayer) this afternoon, checking in with folks, having conversations and scheming ways to meaningful support people that need it now ❤️ Feeling a lot of heart ache for what’s to come and also a lot of sadness and disappointment and disgust with a lot of mainstream Jewish community right now 😢

Stay strong my dear Josh ., we all have no other choice but to be strong 

I really appreciate and proud to hear from you everytime

~

Really glad to know you ❤️

Also if / when it would ever feel good, would love to hear how life is going for you to the extent that you’d like to share :) I know you went off social media at some point and not sure if you’re still playing oud, but I still look back at this every now and then :) Let me know if any other news networks are covering how cool you are, would love to cheer you on 💞 https://fb.watch/nxVA3StjDb/?mibextid=UVffzb
