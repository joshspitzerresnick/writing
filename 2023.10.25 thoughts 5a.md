some thoughts, obviously can take or leave or change what could feel good:

~mood - solemn, mourning, serious, comforting in community
~wearing black?
~acknowledging, validating, sharing pain, grief
~(that said, also very powerful to emphasize resilience, power, solidarity - this is painful and we’re grieving together ofc with different people in different ways to different extents, and also we’re here being held by our community and in it together for the long haul, it gets worse before it gets better, we continue to get stronger and carry those we love and care about in our hearts and minds as we do this work)
~solemn or comforting, soft music if want in background for some time
~silence and holding each other, meeting someone new, hugs, being there for other also powerful
~literally light in darkness

~

materials:
~way for everyone to hear whoever is speaking (megaphone more portable but microphone and speakers likely better quality and less technical difficulties - more of accessibility for crowd vs shouting for a protest, ideally folks can stay where they are in the circle or if possible one person can bring microphone around the circle to people that want to speak)
~candles (could be placed around area in center, designed into words, both?)
~lighters
~aluminum foil
~blankets / kuffiyehs / upside down milk crate / space for folks to put anything in the middle as an altar of sorts to those we’re missing 
~pictures, objects, letters, anything meaningful want to put on alter for who you’re thinking of
~in Jewish tradition can also use small rocks to symbolize people (eg when you visit a grave you leave a rock on the headstone)

~things like tea lights can be lit and set on the ground / made into designs / people can place on foil if ground isn’t sturdy (grass) or near things that might catch fire (kuffiyehs, pictures, letters)
~more traditional candles can be held in hands with foil at bottom to protect from drip

(also realized I can bring 2 lighters, box of shabbos candles that can be wrapped in foil for folks to hold, roll of aluminum foil)

~

activities:
~grounding space
~acknowledging what has happened, how many lost
~acknowledging who is there / their connection to the space, some folks are grieving, others are here with them, all of us are here for each other to hold and lean on
~acknowledge complicated feelings, not knowing all the answers, times when it’s hard to do this work
~depending on how many / if names are available, could read names (or some names, or names of children, families, relatives you know)
~can also mention concepts grieving - loss of connection, longing, trauma passed down in bodies, difficulty to work or study when this happens, lack of support from institutional bodies
~can also mention concepts that are powerful / find comfort in this moment - community, those of us that are here, those of us that fight for each other and folks we may not know

~can go around and let people share who they are grieving, what they are grieving - would suggest starting with SJP folks or folks you trust to set an example of the kind of responses you’d like folks to emulate, then continuing around circle
~can read writing, poetry that is comforting / powerful / acknowledges grieving in the moment
~can invite others you trust to read pieces or their own thoughts (specifically in grieving / solidarity mode, not hype up protest mode) - other Palestinian folks, folks born in the shetat / in the land / in different places with different experiences, supportive professors, folks from other cultural backgrounds with a connection to their own liberation that you also are in solidarity with and have relationship with (eg indigenous, Latino, black, any group that has experienced colonial violence)

~minute(s) of silence, closing eyes to think of folks, feel presence of folks around you
~time for folks to light candles or put them in the middle - depending on how many candles, you could also go around, have people come in the middle and light a candle for each person they are thinking of and say their name (or symbolically light one candle for all the people they are thinking of)
~when Jewish communities are in mourning, during the mourners kaddish (for folks who have passed away or yahrtzeit / anniversary of their death) or during the misheberach for healing (for folks who need healing), before reciting the prayer, a leader goes around or looks around the circle / community and makes eye contact with people to allow them to mention any names of people they are thinking of / wanting to bring into the space / mourning / wanting to send healing to
~can teach simple songs or tunes to hum or things some of the crowd might be familiar with that are comforting

~closing space: comforting tune / soft music / reading, telling people that despite the grief we are in, we are strong - look around the circle and see all the people here to support us / each other, people you know, people you don’t know, say hi and meet someone around you that you’ve never seen before
~tell people to check in on each other, remember to drink water / eat / sleep
~if we can’t take care of ourselves today, we won’t be able to take care of ourselves or others tomorrow
~we’re in this together for the long haul until all of us in all of our communities are free - we need to build relationships, care for each other

~

obviously different context but from the public shiva with 150 or so folks maybe at the intersection of Chicago & Lake this Tuesday 10/10 in case helpful for some ideas / vibe / tone: https://fb.watch/nBCpUsWWSn/

~

what kinds of things do you do in your communities when you are in mourning? ofc there are Palestinians of many faiths and think you can also acknowledge that and bring that into the circle if folks have different ways of mourning they would like to share, but I think familiar communal things are very powerful to share with each other
