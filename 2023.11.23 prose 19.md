Share a brief testimonial about your participation in the Global Day of Fasting for Gaza.

In Judaism we fast during holy and traumatic times. On Yom Kippur, for the destruction of the first and second temples, and for Esther and Gedaliah. This is a holy time, when we are clearly given the choice to be on the right side of history, or to watch as the colonizing militaries of the world fund and perpetuate apartheid and genocide. This is a time when we have the choice to refuse for our grief to be used to oppress another people. This is a time when we have a choice to say that there is no liberation or freedom for my people without liberation and freedom for all people.

This day is a commemoration of genocide and the stealing of land and resources from native peoples, rewritten in history by a settler colonial government. To fast on a day that a settler colonial government has told us to feast and forget the genocide perpetrated by the same government is to say no, to recommit ourselves to liberation for all colonized people in all places.
