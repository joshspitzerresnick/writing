Between Egypt and the world the come
Baemtza <<<

How many hardened hearts until slavery end?
How many no’s until the sea swallows the armies up?
How much pain in Egypt before justice flows like water and … like a heavy rain?

How many tzadiks lost before the city can be saved?
How many tzadiks will we push away?
Do we want to be saved?
Do we want to be a tzadik?

When are we pharaoh and when are we slaves?
When are we running away and when are we pursuing?

God grants us the strength to pursue justice, to stand on the right side of history
God grant us, all of us, the wisdom to know the difference

How many of use will walk out of Egypt?
How many of us will see the world to come?
How many of us want to stay?
How many of us will we bring along?

How many rocks bottoms until we wake up?
How many smashes amongst the boulders?
How many times stuck between a rock and a hard place?
El jdar, allah yerhamha

Who will the gates of Heaven open for?
For the British, for the French, the Dutch, the Germans, the pilgrims?
For manifest destiny?

For Fredrick Douglass or Robert E Lee?
For abolitionists or slave catchers?
For Edward said, for Franz fanon?
For those whose countries are defined by which colonizer they suffered under?
For those inside or outside of the Bantustans?
For those in the reservations or those that put them in the reservations?
For the carpet bombing or the carpet bombed?
For the spreaders or inhalers of gasses?

Will we?
Or will we fade away?
