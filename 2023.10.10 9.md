Collecting my cousins (3)

I haven’t seen you for over 6 years
I haven’t heard from you
I haven’t reached out to talk to you

We were so close
The kids are so much older and bigger now
I got them shirts to wear and think of us growing up, and pass down to their younger siblings
They’re still sitting in my room, packaged and ready to send to you
They’ve followed me through moving every or every other year
Staring at me
They’re too small for the kids now, maybe their youngest siblings

You were some of the last people I saw and said goodbye to when I left
Our separation was so complete

~

I used to have nightmares
I dreamt that after a fight and my parents didn’t understand me, I ran away
After many years, I come back down the street I grew up

(italics)
I’m crying for the first time in the middle of writing this
It’s Tuesday the 10th, I’ve been running on adrenaline and Instagram stories since shabbos morning on simchat torah

My parents are still there
Tired, weary, older
So much older

I cry
I didn’t mean to hurt them
I felt angry and sad and confused and not understood
I didn’t know what emotions were
I knew I felt uncomfortable
My chest tightens, I seize up, it’s hard to breathe
I want to escape, I want crawl out of my skin like a snake
I need fresh air
I want to drink cold water

I want to run out
I’m between a rock and a hard place and I’m doing my best
I want to escape this narrow place

כל העולם כולו גשר צר מאוד
והיקר לא לפחד כלל

~

I don’t know what you think of me anymore
I never returned

Grandpa is older and not doing well
I wonder what memories my nieces and nephews have of me
Do they remember?
Do they wonder why this cousin came and left?
We got ice cream together
We played together
Neither of us knew each other

You’ve seen some of my stories
Maybe you’ve googled my name
Maybe you know I’m not sure if I’m allowed to come back
My friends sure aren’t allowed to see their families anymore

~

I came back
Not home, but a different place
I don’t know what home is now
The place I called home doesn’t feel quite like home anymore
I’ve been here for a while now, I’ve made some friends
Thankfully I was able to stay in one place since a little while into the pandemic
It’s the longest time I’ve been in one place since I left my first home
Maybe home is where I put my roots down
Where I make connections
Where I find community
Where I give of myself and expect nothing in return
Sometimes others do too

שורשים
جذور

My roots are my building blocks
Everything I am, everything I come from stems from them
I try to follow their north star
The path isn’t clear
How do I cross the sea?
How do I get to freedom?

My building blocks change and shape shift
I learn and I teach
I hurt and I am hurt
I love and I am loved
I care for and I am cared for




~

I try to do good things now
I finally finished school, I tried to find an ethical job
I try to live the values my community raised me with
What do I do when it’s not clear what to do?
What do I do when my values say one thing and my family says another?

I’m a little more mature now, I understand a few more things
I can notice patterns
I can notice trauma responses and coping mechanisms
It takes a long time and usually others have to point out to me when my coping mechanism
I lost a long term relationship over that
My heart has been shattered now, a few different ways
I try to pick up the pieces
It’s not whole or complete
There are parts missing
People missing

~ (italics)

Someone was once very proud of their perfect heart
They told all the village how perfect their heart was
Come to see it, they said
Indeed, it was so smooth and perfect and unblemished

An elder came up to their person
My heart is more beautiful than yours, they said
Impossible
My heart has been torn apart and stitched back together
It doesn’t fit perfectly
There are many rough edges
There are wholes that were never filled

I have given many pieces of my heart away, the elder said
Some people have given pieces of their own heart in return
Some have not

But it is beautiful
I have given of myself and expected nothing in return
Sometimes others have shared of themselves with me
Would you like a piece of my heart?

The young person cried
This old elder looked very frail, very worn
Time had taken a toll on their body
Time had given their soul wisdom, kindness, righteousness

חסד
צדק

The young person looked at his perfect, unblemished heart
A heart they had kept guarded and protected
Nobody could see or touch it
Shields up like an open wound
An open wound that cannot be cleaned and bandaged and start to heal
They let down their guard
They let another heart in

It looked more jagged now
Not all the edges fit
But it was beautiful

~

I was scared to reach out
“Thank you”
“Fuck them”

My heart aches
I’ve heard many things
I’m scared for you

I want to send my love, my care, my support
My open ears if it would feel good
To feel feelings
To talk, to vent, to scream
To call out for help

I don’t know the answers
I’m not sure I can help problem solve
I am here though
I care
I love you
I want to present

הינני

My mom’s family only knows how to communicate with food
Sometimes it helps
Sometimes I don’t know what to say
I’ll sit here with you
I want to listen
I want to acknowledge, validate, have hope for the future
If you’ll allow me, I want to cook for you
I want you to know you are loved and cared for and have people around you that want to support you
If you’ll allow me

When I feel bad, sometimes I know know what to say
Sometimes I want to escape and not think about it
Sometimes I’m thinking about it a lot, just quietly
Sometimes I don’t want a solution or a plan
(indent)
My dad gets annoyed when I ask him what to do and then I ignore his advice
I do that a lot
I tend to need to find things out the hard way, then I realize what people meant
What they were trying to protect me from
They care about me so they don’t want me to hurt
Sometimes I can only appreciate what they mean when I feel what it means to hurt
(end indent)
Sometimes the most helpful thing is just silence
Presence
I want to be held
I want to know that someone is physically there and cares for me
I don’t know the solution
But at least with two of us I won’t be alone

Sometimes when I don’t know what to do, my body just starts moving
I cook, I clean, I fold my laundry
I catch up on everything I didn’t need to do
Everything except the big stressful elephant in the room

Bees are jumping around inside my head
I try to catch them and take a look at them
I try to tell others, write down what I saw
They fly away

I want to be a traffic director, a conductor
Tell all the bees in the hive where to go, how to make the music sweeter
No, I don’t like telling people what to do
They know better than I know, I’m not a bee
I don’t make honey or carry it
Maybe I could be the information desk
Lost bees with honey that don’t know where to go
Confused, scared
They have so much inside them and they don’t know what to do with it
I’d find some of the places that need honey, I’d tell them
Hopefully their honey will make those places a little sweeter

Connecting
Weaving

Memory is fleeting
I used to be very independent
If something happened, I remembered the way it happened
Now I’m not sure
Did it happen?
Was it a dream?
A mix?
Was I there?
Did I really do that?
I need physical proof to remind myself
To cue my memory
To set the scene

Growing up, dad told me I have such a selective memory
My previous partner was hurt when I didn’t remember important things
I tried to take notes
(tab)
I have a lot of them
(untab)
Did I not care enough?
If we argued, I didn’t know who was right
My instinct told me it happened another way
I gave in
She remembers conversations pretty well, she was probably right
It doesn’t matter if I’m right though
I want to validate her and apologize and take responsibility
But did it happen?
I don’t remember

Now I work in fragments
It’s hard to keep the whole picture in mind
I might forget my point
Sometimes others understand me
I like when they find me

Before my grandpa passed away, he couldn’t talk
What he wanted to say wouldn’t come out of his mouth
That happened to me once
I felt out of control
I needed help
I felt like a burden

I listened to him
I talked to him
I asked him questions
Where did our family come from?
He didn’t answer
He looked at me

My dad and grandma tried to comfort me
It’s no use, he can’t communicate
Talk to your great aunt if you want to know about the family
He’s on his way out
Don’t be upset, he’s been this way for a long time
You were too small to remember when he could talk to you

He did communicate
Sorrow, longing, remorse
Hope, love, appreciation
He wanted to cry
He could tell I understood
I cared
I was there
Present
His body didn’t understand him very well

My cousins
My Bubbe used to visit you every winter
I was there the last time she came
Her memory was also fading, she gradually talked less and less

She used to play piano
Recently she took a few lessons to reminder her fingers
She was embarrassed
She didn’t remember what she used to
She didn’t feel she was as good anymore

Before she left her home, I found her music
If I were a rich man
Sunrise, sunset
I tried playing it on my Bubbe’s piano
She told me to stop
I played it when she wasn’t there
I cried

It was winter
She lived not too far from you
Her parents spoke Yiddish in the home
She and my Zayde in law were the last two native Yiddish speakers I knew
She couldn’t read or write it
Only in the home

My Zayde in law was a doctor
Everyone had to serve in the military when he was young
When we was there, he met another doctor that spoke Yiddish
He had so many stories about him
It’s been a very long time since he’s had someone to speak Yiddish with

Their children don’t speak Yiddish
My parents thought it was a dirty language
My grandpa and Bubbe used it to talk behind their backs when they didn’t want the children to understand
They picked up a few words here and there

I asked my Zayde how to pronounce Zayde
Bubbe
Bobeh
Mother, father
It depends on where you’re from
Different people have different accents, sometimes even different words
Where am I from?
Tevye didn’t tell me
What accent do I speak?
My parents don’t speak
My grandpa can’t speak anymore
My bubbe can listen more than she can teach me

I’m going on tangents again

~

How are you?
How is life?
How are you feeling?
How is your partner?
How are your parents?
How are your kids?

Are you safe?
I heard the military is moving people south
Maybe also north now?
I don’t want them to go
I want you to be safe
I want others to be safe
I don’t want you to hurt or be hurt

Your husband does something he’s not allow to tell us or you
He’s Mizrachi, he speaks Arabic
I hope he’s safe

I studied Arabic there
The teacher used to live in Har Gilo
Some of my classmates wanted to learn the language their grandparents spoke
Some were from Iraq
One girl wanted to go into the modiin
The intelligence

I was the only one who didn’t natively speak Hebrew
I learned how to speak Arabic in Hebrew letters
The Minerva dictionary, Olive Tree dictionary in English
Who used this dictionary?
Why?
Was is peaceful?
I got an 80%, one of the higher scores I got in my classes then

יוחנן אליחי

I had to travel a few hours to get that one
I spent a weekend in a place my friends aren’t allowed to go now
Much longer than that actually
I didn’t realize a publishing house wasn’t a book store, there were a little confused when I came into an office with boxes and stacks of books
Near Keren HaYesod
The foundational fund

~

I came back here in 2017
I learned Arabic again
The teachers were Egyptian
The director was Dutch
Some of my classmates wanted to learn the language their family speaks
Some of them thought I did too
I was white and had curly hair, maybe I had some Crusader in me
I talked about my experiences all the time
They talked about their experiences too

Some thought Arabic looked cool
They liked calligraphy
They had some pretty clothes they got from their travels
I hope they took an Orientalism class

Some had some nice values
They liked languages
They liked people getting what they need
They liked understanding others

Half were in the military
I guess they have a really good school for languages there
Some of their partners spoke Arabic
Some wanted to be in the military
Or the CIA
Or the FBI
Modiin

A different dictionary
Hans Wehr
German
Much larger, or at least the width of the paper was
Who used this dictionary?
Why?
Was it peaceful?
I did well in my classes, it was easier for me having some background and knowing a cognate language

I studied computers too, I thought it would get me a job
The military likes people that study languages, they give them a lot of money
Many people thought I would get a good job working for the government, or an oil company
Modiin

I ask a lot of questions
I was told that’s a good thing
A Jewish value
For every two Jewish people, there are at least three opinions
Each of them is objectively right

I keep asking questions
Sometimes people don’t like when you ask questions
Sometimes questions have boundaries, boarders
I need to see your paperwork before this question can enter
Are you from my community? Do you understand me? Do you care about me? What is your intent?

Sometimes I didn’t see the borders
Borders are funny materials
Porous and non porous
Thin and thick
Hard and soft
I can go through, my friend cannot
My friend can’t go out, but not in
The dog over there goes wherever it likes
The birds don’t seem to mind
Do they have borders?
